  /**
   * Returns a gate that evaluates to true if and only if the corresponding
   * gates in the argument buses evaluate to the same values.
   * That is, the gate evaluates to true iff
   * bus1 and bus2 evaluate to the same bit sequence (binary number).
   *
   * For instance, assume that aa and bb are buses with 3 bits.
   * When aa evaluates to 100 (4 in decimal) and bb to 110 (6 in decimal),
   * then the gate buildEqual(aa, bb) evaluates to false.
   *
   * Hints:
   *
   * (1)  First, for each i, you may want to build a gate that evaluates 
   *      to true iff the gates bus1(i) and bus2(i) have the same value 
   *      (that is, either both are false or both are true).
   *      You can do this either with, say, a while-loop over i or 
   *      with bus-level operations (the latter approach takes about
   *      half a line of Scala code).
   *      Also observe that the study material for Round 2 contains 
   *      an example of a small circuit that evaluates to true iff two 
   *      inputs have the same value. What you need to do is to build 
   *      this circuit repeatedly for each pair of matching gates, 
   *      bus1(i) and bus2(i).
   * (2)  Second, you need to make sure that all the gates you constructed
   *      in (1) have the value true. You may want to consider taking
   *      the AND of the gates, one two-input AND-gate at a time. That is, 
   *      you have a gate g whose output is the AND of the first j gates,
   *      and you obtain the AND of the first j+1 gates by constructing a
   *      two-input AND with g and the (j+1)th gate as inputs.
   *      Alternatively, you may, say, do a "reduceLeft" across the bus. 
   * (3)  A drawing of one possible circuit that you can build is available
   *      (in the case when bus1 and bus2 both have length 4) in the
   *      A+-page of this assignment, with parts (1) and (2) highlighted.
   *      To successfully solve this task, you only need to generalize to
   *      lengths other than 4.

  /**s
   * The unsigned less-than comparator.
   * Returns a gate that evaluates to true if and only if
   * the evaluated value of bus1 is less than that of bus2
   * in unsigned binary.
   * The buses must be non-empty and of same length.
   *
   * For instance, assume that aa and bb are buses with 3 bits.
   * When aa evaluates to 100 (4 in decimal) and bb to 110 (6 in decimal),
   * then the gate buildUnsignedLess(aa, bb) evaluates to true.
   *
   * Hints: 
   *
   * (1)  You should preferably solve the assignment "buildEqual" 
   *      before attempting this assignment. 
   * (2)  Do not worry, you need not engage in serious thinking yet,
   *      this is why we have hints ... :-)
   * (3)  All right, so precisely what is it that makes one 
   *      (unsigned) binary integer ___less than___ another? 
   *      Let us put our thinking cap on and engage in some (guided)
   *      thinking. 
   *      To start with, in most cases when one is forced to think, 
   *      it is a good strategy to think first in terms of concrete 
   *      examples. Above we used 100 (4 in decimal) and 110 (6 in decimal) 
   *      as an example. So what is it that makes 100 less than 110 ? 
   *      Well, obviously the sequences need to differ in at least
   *      one bit position, since otherwise the sequences would be
   *      equal. Indeed, we observe that 100 and 110 differ in position 1.
   *      Furthermore, 100 is __less than__ 110 __in position 1__. 
   *      Aha! It looks like we are getting somewhere. 
   * (4)  So now let us think really hard (again with guidance to ease
   *      the amount of thinking that needs to be done), 
   *      in terms of bus1 and bus2. Exactly when is it the case
   *      that bus1 is less than bus2 ? 
   *      If bus1 and bus2 do not differ in any position, they are equal. 
   *      So let us assume that bus1 and bus2 are different, in one or 
   *      more position(s). Exactly when is it the case that bus1 is less 
   *      than bus2 ? 
   * (5)  Suppose j is the __largest__ position in which bus1 and bus2
   *      differ (remember that we now assume that there is at least one
   *      such j, so we may just as well consider the largest such j). 
   * (6)  We claim that bus1 is __less than__ bus2 if and only if it holds 
   *      that both  bus1(j) has the value 0  (here 0 is the same as false) 
   *            and  bus2(j) has the value 1  (here 1 is the same as true).  
   *      [[Indeed, you may want to formally prove this for yourself,
   *      say, by observing that 2^j is greater than any binary integer that
   *      has nonzero bits in only the j-1 least significant bit positions.
   *      Recall the power series summation formula. For the purposes of
   *      this assignment however we need no such proof.]]
   * (7)  Now we understand exactly when bus1 is less than bus2,
   *      so all that remains to be done is to translate this understanding 
   *      into a circuit design. 
   * (8)  So let us think really hard what we want the circuit to do.
   *      Let us use the intuition above to define a goal that we want
   *      achieve with our design.
   * (9)  Suppose our goal is to have a gate g(i) whose value is true 
   *      if and only if the largest value j <= i, if there is such a value, 
   *      where bus1(j) and bus2(j) are different, is a value where 
   *      bus1(j) has the value 0 and bus2(j) has the value 1. 
   *      (Or in slightly less precise terms, the 
   *      largest difference up to position i, if any, indicates
   *      that bus1 is less than bus2.)
   * (10) Our goal looks a bit tedious, but it has been chosen with
   *      care to meet our objective. Indeed, if we have
   *      gate g(l-1) with l == bus1.length == bus2.length, we are done:
   *      then the value of gate g(l-1) tells us exactly whether bus1 
   *      is less than bus2.
   * (11) At the other extreme, we observe that gate g(0) is easy to construct.
   *      Indeed, g(0) is true if and only if bus1(0) is false 
   *      and bus2(0) is true. 
   * (12) Here comes the final, hard part as regards thinking. 
   *      Suppose we have available gate g(i-1), and we must 
   *      construct gate g(i). What should we do? 
   *      Well, of course we have available also the values bus1(i)
   *      and bus2(i). In fact, we can formulate a truth table
   *      for g(i) based on the values of bus1(i), bus2(i), and g(i-1).
   *      We display the table below, with comments to justify 
   *      each value of g(i).
   *
   *      bus1(i)  bus2(i)  g(i-1) | g(i) | Comments
   *      -------------------------+------+-----------------------------------
   *         0       0         0   |   0  | no difference at i, so forward i-1
   *         0       0         1   |   1  | no difference at i, so forward i-1
   *         0       1         0   |   1  | difference at i, less than
   *         0       1         1   |   1  | difference at i, less than
   *         1       0         0   |   0  | difference at i, not less than
   *         1       0         1   |   0  | difference at i, not less than
   *         1       1         0   |   0  | no difference at i, so forward i-1
   *         1       1         1   |   1  | no difference at i, so forward i-1
   * 
   * (13) Now you can synthesize the circuit, using, say, one for-loop 
   *      over i, and perhaps using in the loop a helper function of 
   *      the form ...
   *
   *      def buildGategi(b1i: Gate, b2i: Gate, giminus1: Gate): Gate = {
   *        ???
   *      }
   *
   *      ... that returns a "gate g(i)" when given a "gate bus1(i)",
   *      a "gate bus2(i)", and a "gate g(i-1)" as parameters. 
   *      Look at function "buildAdder" below for an example on how to
   *      make a for-loop over the gates of two buses. 
   * (14) Recall how we synthesized half adders and full adders
   *      from a truth table in the Round 2 material. The same procedure
   *      can be applied to the truth table in (12). 
   * (15) If all else fails, build the circuit first for a bus of
   *      length 1, then for a bus of length 2, then for a bus of length 3,
   *      and so forth, in each case using Toggler to check that your
   *      circuit works.
