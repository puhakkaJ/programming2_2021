   *
   * Let us start this assignment with an easy task. 
   * You are to build a rotation of feedbacks on a bus of state elements 
   * that you get as input. 
   *
   * In somewhat more precise terms, when the clock triggers, it
   * must be the case that
   *
   *   state(0) feeds back to state(state.length-1),
   *   state(1) feeds back to state(0),
   *   state(2) feeds back to state(1),
   *   state(3) feeds back to state(2),
   *
   *   ..., and so forth, until finally,
   *
   *   state(state.length-1) feeds back to state(state.length-2).
   * 
   * Remark:
   * A rotator can be used to cycle through a sequence of bits loaded
   * to the state elements. In fact, if you think about the oscillator
   * assignment, this is precisely what we did in that assignment.
   * Rotators can be used to build, e.g. a rotating text display
   * by using one rotator to drive one line of display elements
   * such as LEDs.

  /**
   * A 5-bit linear-feedback shift register (a 5-bit LFSR).
   *
   * In many applications, in particular in cryptography, it is useful
   * to be able to cycle through a long sequence of distinct states 
   * using only very little hardware to do so. 
   *
   * A ___linear-feedback shift register___ (an __LFSR___) is a sequential 
   * logic circuit with b bits of internal state that can be used to
   * cycle through a sequence of up to 2^b-1 states. For example,
   * with b = 100 we can cycle through a sequence of 
   * 2^100-1 = 1267650600228229401496703205375 distinct states. 
   *
   * An LFSR is in structure almost equivalent to a rotator. 
   * Indeed, with the exception of the feedback to state(state.length-1),
   * the feedbacks are precisely the same. Namely, in an LFSR, 
   *
   *   state(1) feeds back to state(0),
   *   state(2) feeds back to state(1),
   *   state(3) feeds back to state(2),
   *
   *   ..., and so forth, until finally,
   *
   *   state(state.length-1) feeds back to state(state.length-2).
   *
   * What makes an LFSR different from a rotator is the feedback
   * to state(state.length-1). Namely, this feedback is obtained
   * from the exclusive-or (the XOR) of two or more of the
   * state bits. These bits are called the __tap bits__ (or __taps__)
   * for the LFSR. 
   *
   * Depending on the tap bits chosen, we can obtain a cycle of 
   * up to 2^b-1 distinct states when the LFSR is initialized 
   * with a non-all-zero state. In general to obtain the maximal
   * length 2^b-1, the tap bits have to be very carefully chosen.
   *
   * This task asks you to implement a maximal LFSR for 5 bits.
   * In more precise terms, the taps 0 and 2, that is, tapping 
   * the state elements state(0) and state(2), will produce 
   * a sequence of 2^5-1 = 31 distinct states as the clock is
   * triggered.
   *  
   * You will get as input a bus of 5 state elements, and your
   * task is to build the required feedbacks and the logic gates
   * that implement a 5-bit LFSR with taps 0 and 2.
   * Furthermore, you should initialize (set) the state elements
   * so that state element 0 is set to true and all the other
   * state elements are false. 
   * Finally, you should give as return value the bus of state elements.
   *
   * Hints: 
   * Test your design in Trigger (see the object "play" for example code). 
   * If your design is correct, clocking the LFSR repeatedly will cycle it 
   * through 31 distinct 5-bit states and then return back to the initial 
   * state. You can also compare your design with the illustration in the
   * accompanying material. XOR gates are available in minilog 
   * via the operator ^^.

   * @param state the state elements for the LFSR

   * @return a new LFSR that is built and initialized as instructed below
   * 
   * This task asks you to implement a generic LFSR-builder function that 
   * constructs the desired taps and feedbacks based on a list of taps and 
   * a bus of state elements given as input. (A detailed description of LFSRs
   * is given in the comments above.) 
   * 
   * If the LFSR has b bits of state, the tap values in the list must be 
   * chosen from {1, 2, ..., b-1}. That is to say, we assume that the
   * state element 0 is always tapped (and it should not occur in the list).
   * In particular, an empty tap list should create a rotator unit.
   * 
   * Your task is to write the builder function that builds the feedbacks and
   * taps. Unlike with the 5-bit LFSR above, the state of this LFSR is allowed 
   * to be initialized so that any state element can be initially set to either 
   * true or false. 
   * 
   * Hint:
   * To test your code you can use the fact that for b = 3 both the tap 
   * list {1} and the tap list {2} give LFSRs that cycle through all the 
   * non-zero states. See the task above for further hints.
