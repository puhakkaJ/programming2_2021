  /**
   * This task asks you to implement a builder for a sequential logic unit that
   * implements one word of memory. 
   *
   * The one-word memory unit must support two basic operations: 
   * reading and writing a word. These operations amount to supporting 
   * the following, more detailed specification.
   * All of the following requirements must be met:
   *
   * 1)
   * A read is issued at time t by setting "readEnable" to true. 
   * In this case the output bus at time t must have values identical to 
   * the word stored in the unit. Reading the memory should not require 
   * the circuit to be clocked.
   * 
   * 2)
   * If "readEnable" is false at time t, each gate in the output bus at 
   * time t must also have value false. As in the previous case, clocking 
   * the circuit should not be required for the effect to take place.
   *
   * 3)
   * A write is issued at time t by setting "writeEnable" to true, 
   * setting "data" to equal the word that we want to store in the unit, 
   * and clocking the circuit. When the clock triggers, "data" should be 
   * saved to the word stored inside the unit.
   * (Thus, in particular the output of a read at time t+1 should be 
   * identical to "data" at time t, assuming "writeEnable" was true at time 
   * t and the clock was triggered.) 
   *
   * 4)
   * If "writeEnable" is false at time t, clocking the circuit should not 
   * affect the word stored in the unit. In particular, the contents of 
   * "data" at time t should not affect the word stored in the unit. 
   *
   * Your function should return an output bus matching this specification.
   *
   * Hints: 
   * You will need to build internal state elements (that is, input elements) 
   * to store data in the unit. You can do this by first getting the host 
   * circuit (e.g. by calling readEnable.host) and then requesting a bus of
   * input elements (with length identical to "data") from the host.
   * Think carefully how to build feedbacks to the internal state elements. 
   * A direct feedback from "data" will not work, but rather you want a feedback
   * either from the internal state or "data". This requires combinational 
   * logic. For example, the function buildBusSelector given above may be 
   * helpful. Use Trigger to test your design. Again the object "play" may 
   * be helpful.

   * In this task we get more ambitious. Namely, we want a memory unit capable 
   * of storing multiple words. In fact, 2^b words to be precise, with b >= 1.
   *
   * The unit must support reads and writes addressing to specific words among
   * the 2^b words. The address is supplied in the b-bit bus "address". That is,
   * b is equal to address.length. In precise terms, all of the following 
   * requirements must be met:
   *
   * 1)
   * A read is issued at time t by setting "readEnable" to true and setting 
   * "address" to the address of the word that we want to read. In this case 
   * the output bus at time t must have values identical to the word with 
   * address "address" stored in the unit. Reading the memory should not 
   * require the circuit to be clocked.
   *
   * 2)
   * If "readEnable" is false at time t, each gate in the output bus at 
   * time t must also have value false. Clocking the circuit should not be 
   * required for the effect to take place.
   * 
   * 3)
   * A write is issued at time t by setting "writeEnable" to true, setting 
   * "data" to equal the word that we want to store in the unit, setting 
   * "address" to equal the address of the word that is to receive the write, 
   * and clocking the circuit. When the clock triggers, "data" should be 
   * saved to the word with address "address" stored inside the unit.
   *
   * 4)
   * If "writeEnable" is false at time t, clocking the circuit should not 
   * affect any of the words stored in the unit. In particular, the contents 
   * of "data" at time t should not affect any of the words stored in the unit. 
   *
   * Your function should return an output bus matching this specification.
   *
   * Hints:
   * If you want, you may use buildOneWordMemory as a subroutine to build the 
   * memory unit. You may want to use decoder circuits built with buildDecoder 
   * to select where to write and where to read. Bus selectors can be built 
   * with buildBusSelector. Use Trigger to test your design.
