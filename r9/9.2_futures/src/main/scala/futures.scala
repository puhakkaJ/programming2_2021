   * (for example, a database query interface and other online services) 
   * that are external to our program. Such services take time to complete 
   * (say, the database must be searched), and while waiting for 
   * completion (success or failure) our program should yield 
   * the computational resources to other uses. In short, our program 
   * should execute aggressively and use all available resources for
   * parallel execution when it has available all the values that it needs 
   * to advance its computations, and otherwise yield the resources to 
   * other use. This should happen automatically and transparently, 
   * without us as programmers paying attention to any of it. Ideally, 
   * our program should have the clarity of a sequential implementation, 
   * even if in practice the computations are carried out in parallel 
   * and scheduled aggressively. 
   *
   * Let us start with a set of "services" that for simplicity take 
   * zero or more integer parameters and an return integer value:

   * (in object Services) gets called at that point in the future,
   * and the return value from the underlying function will then complete 
   * the future object that your wrapper function returns.

   * Hint: use maps, flatMaps, and/or for-comprehensions to 
   * carry out the wrapping. Refer back to Tasks 1 and 2 for guidance.
