   * when we know two points, lower and upper, such that f(lower) <= 0.0 and f(upper) >= 0.0.
   * Implement this with an algorithm using binary search.
   * Recall the limited precision of Doubles! That is, the new "middle point" can (and will)
   * at some point be equal to either to lower or upper point. You can stop the search when
   * this happens and return the better point (lower or upper limit point).
   *
   * The recommended programming style for this exercise is to use recursion
   * (please see the section "Binary Search" of Round 7 and Round 8 of the course material
   * if you are not familiar with recursion yet).
