   * So far we have worked with sequences of integers. Let us

   *
   * Recall that in Scala a pair is an object x of type Tuple2[A,B],

   * the components of x.
   *
   * For example, if we are working with a pair x of integers

  /*
   * Task 9:
   * Here we learn the useful idiom of _zipping_ two given sequences
   * (with the same length) into one sequence of pairs.
   *
   * In short, it often happens that you have two sequences, a and b,
   * and you need to do something to the elements in matching
   * positions in those sequences. That is, you want to work with
   * the elements a(i) and b(i) for each position
   * i=0,1,...,min(a.length,b.length)-1
   *
   * Clearly this is a situation where one would like to use a 'map',
   * but unfortunately map only work on the elements of one sequence.
   * The solutions is to __zip__ the sequences a and b to produce a
   * sequence consisting of the pairs (a(i),b(i)) for each i.
   * To zip a with b, we call the 'zip' method of a:
   *
   *    a.zip(b)
   *
   * or what is the same but using operator syntax,
   *
   *    a zip b
   *
   * The result is a sequence z such that z(i) is the pair (a(i),b(i))
   * for all i=0,1,...,min(a.length,b.length)-1.
   *
   * All right. So let us now practice zipping.
   *
   * Let us start with something really simple. Suppose we have
   * two sequences of integers, a and b, both of length d.
   * We may view these sequences as d-dimensional vectors.
   * So how do we compute the sum of these two vectors?
   * Clearly, the sum s = a + b should satisfy s(i) == a(i) + b(i)
   * for each i = 0,1,...,d-1.
   *
   * So why not 'zip' the two sequences, to obtain a sequence
   * of pairs (a(i),b(i)). Then, to form the sum vector,
   * all we need is a 'map' that sums up each pair ...

  /*
   * Task 12:

   *
   * Sequences have two useful methods, take(j: Int) and drop(j: Int),
   * that take or drop the _first_ (=lowest-numbered) j positions
   * of the sequence and return the resulting sequence.
   * There are also dual methods, takeRight(j: Int) and dropRight(j: Int),

   * Often it is necessary to work with the elements of a sequence
   * (e.g. using a 'map') in such a way that we have access to
   * the position where the element occurs. In such cases it is useful
   * to first zip the original sequence with a sequence of indices
   * to the sequence. That is, each element in the sequence gets paired
   * with its index (its position number) in the sequence.
   * While we could do this with a quick idiom such as
   *
   *     a zip (0 until a.length)
   *
   * there is in fact a separate method in class Seq that does precisely

   * is achieved more succinctly by
   *
   *     a.zipWithIndex
   *
   * Let us now look at an example why zipping with the index is useful.
   * Suppose you have a sequence of integers and you need to find
   * the index where the (first occurrence of the) maximum value in the
   * sequence occurs. That is, if a(i) is the maximum of a, we need to
   * find out i for the minimum such i.
   * Implement a method that uses zipWithIndex to find the first
   * index with the maximum value in the sequence a.

   * of a maximum. However, you should not solve this exercise

   * More formally the _scan_ operator applied to a sequence s scans a
   * given associative operator over the prefixes of s and returns a
   * sequence r consisting of the intermediate result at each prefix of s.
   * In particular, the result at the empty prefix is the given natural
   * element, and more generally the value at position j in the returned
   * sequence is identical to the result of a fold executed on the prefix
   * of length j of s.
   *
   * Your task is to use 'scan' to compute a running sum across

   * should contain the sum of in(0),in(1),...,in(j).

   * Again there are many was to solve this task, but using a 'scan'
   * is preferred. Also recall that you may use 'take' and 'drop' to
   * trim a sequence.
